NormalScripts
=============

Some things that I usually need in every machine.

To get started, call in a terminal:

```bash
wget https://raw.github.com/eduardoshanahan/NormalScripts/master/GetUbuntuUsualSuspects.sh
chmod +w GetUbuntuUsualSuspects.sh
sudo ./GetUbuntuUsualSuspects.sh
```

and you have Git to work from there.
